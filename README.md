# VolumeNormalizer

This repository was made for normalising the volumes of media files.

It is built as a utility package for ensuring that dynamic range is well balanced and volumes are acceptable. Thus, it has no intention of being a registered package in the General registry.

## Installation

```julia
julia> ]add https://github.com/dzonimn/VolumeNormalizer
```

## Usage

```julia
normalize(filepath)
```
